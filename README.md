SED1531
=======

arduino library for working with the SED1531 (controller/glcd)

A thing I noticed is that if you use the sketch below and my library (on my arduino) the screen

goes blank after a while.

Also reseting the arduino does not reset the lcd.

These might be things to look at and keep in mind, I will try to work these out and try

fix this.

if you find any problem any at al,
